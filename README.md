Here I post my pet projects in R and Python:)


# [Movie Recommendation System with Network and Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/vittoriashch/Pet-projects/tree/main/R_projects)
This project aims to create an effective movie recommendation system using a combination of network analysis, text and sentiment analysis, and recommendation algorithms. The goal is to predict user preferences and suggest films tailored to their interests.

***Key Features:***

### Network Analysis : 
Identifies communities within films and suggests movies for users without clear preferences.

### Sentiment Analysis : 
Analyzes movie reviews to enhance recommendations by understanding user sentiment.

### Recommendation Systems : 
Implements Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based approaches to recommend movies.
This project evaluates the effectiveness of these methods and provides insights through data visualization.

# [Oil price prediction with the use of DL](https://github.com/vittoriashch/Pet-projects/blob/main/Python_projects/Oil_price_prediction%20(2).ipynb)

This project is dedicated to the development and deployment of several neural networks aimed at predicting Brent crude oil prices. The primary goal is to create a model capable of forecasting price fluctuations based on key factors influencing the current energy market and economic conditions.

## Objectives
The project aims to:
* Predict Brent Oil Prices: Utilize modern machine learning techniques to analyze and forecast price movements in the oil market.
* Analyze Influencing Factors: Investigate various economic and energy indicators, such as supply and demand, geopolitical events, regulatory changes, and other external factors that may impact prices.
* Optimize Models: Apply different neural network architectures, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and RNN (Recurrent neural network), to achieve maximum prediction accuracy.

## Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.

# [Probability of Default](https://github.com/vittoriashch/Pet-projects/blob/main/Python_projects/Probability%20of%20default%20pet-project-4.ipynb)

This project is aimed to implement a predictive model to assess the probability of loan default using machine learning techniques. It analyzes various financial and personal characteristics of borrowers to predict whether they will be able to meet their loan obligations.

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) section is complete and ready for you to explore and investigate. I'm currently finalizing the machine learning and estimation components, so stay tuned for updates!
