# [Movie Recommendation System with Network and Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/vittoriashch/Pet-projects/tree/main/R_projects)
This project aims to create an effective movie recommendation system using a combination of network analysis, text and sentiment analysis, and recommendation algorithms. The goal is to predict user preferences and suggest films tailored to their interests.

*Key Features:*

### Network Analysis : 
Identifies communities within films and suggests movies for users without clear preferences.

### Sentiment Analysis : 
Analyzes movie reviews to enhance recommendations by understanding user sentiment.

### Recommendation Systems : 
Implements Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based approaches to recommend movies.
This project evaluates the effectiveness of these methods and provides insights through data visualization.
