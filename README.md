Here I post my pet projects in R and Python:)


# [Movie Recommendation System with Network and Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/vittoriashch/Pet-projects/tree/main/R_projects)
This project aims to create an effective movie recommendation system using a combination of network analysis, text and sentiment analysis, and recommendation algorithms. The goal is to predict user preferences and suggest films tailored to their interests.

***Key Features:***

### Network Analysis : 
Identifies communities within films and suggests movies for users without clear preferences.

### Sentiment Analysis : 
Analyzes movie reviews to enhance recommendations by understanding user sentiment.

### Recommendation Systems : 
Implements Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based approaches to recommend movies.
This project evaluates the effectiveness of these methods and provides insights through data visualization.


# [Probability of Default](https://github.com/vittoriashch/Pet-projects/blob/main/Python_projects/Probability%20of%20default%20pet-project-4.ipynb)

This project is aimed to implement a predictive model to assess the probability of loan default using machine learning techniques. It analyzes various financial and personal characteristics of borrowers to predict whether they will be able to meet their loan obligations.

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) section is complete and ready for you to explore and investigate. I'm currently finalizing the machine learning and estimation components, so stay tuned for updates!

## Description

The primary goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. The project encompasses several key stages:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant datasets that contain borrower information.
2. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure it is ready for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and analyzing the data to identify patterns and insights.
4. **Model Training**: Using various machine learning algorithms to train models on the dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.

## Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
